I'm a scientist & developer in Open-Source AI. My current project is to make finetuning large models really fast.

Before that I took a sabbatical to transition from banking strategy consulting into deeptech AI R&D. I did that by contributing to [HuggingFace diffusers](), and previously [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and [gpt-engineeer](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer) (where I became maintainer for a while).

I gave a [well-received lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdTsX6DQk24) on OpenAI Triton, a languge to easily program gpus, which led to this:

On this site I share my learnings from doing AI R&D, and share writings on anything I find interesting.

Feel free to get in touch via umer.hayat.adil at gmail.com or [Twitter (@UmerHAdil)](https://x.com/UmerHAdil)!

PS: I like to create local community by e.g. [organizing street festivals](https://twitter.com/UmerHAdil/status/1718753246309695644).
