title: "Use tabulate to make output more beautiful"

With the [tabulate library](https://github.com/astanin/python-tabulate) by Sergey Astanin you can remove a bit of coginitive load (and therefore be more productive) by making output look more beautiful.

Does more beautiful output really reduce coginitive load? Yes. Because it allows you to extract the information you need directly by glancing, without any layout parsing. So more thought is shifted from [your System 2 to your System 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory).

In this example, I was reimplementing [Half Quadratic Quantization](https://github.com/mobiusml/hqq) in order to really understand it (so I can then make it really fast). Look how clean it looks!

Highly recommend you use it.
