# Hi, I‚Äôm UmerHA! üëãüèΩ

I'm a **machine learning engineer who loves to contribute to Open-Source AI**. After contributing to "AI engineering" project [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) ([see contributions](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AUmerHA+)) and [gpt-engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/) (now a maintainer; [see contributions](https://github.com/antonosika/gpt-engineer/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AUmerHA+)), I am now interested in ML engineering and have contributed do [HuggingFace diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/) (contributions: [ControlNet-XS](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/5827), [Prompt-2-Prompt](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/4563)).

I'm also very interested in code generation!

You're the target audience of my blog, if (like my 6 months past self) you:
- want to deeply understand cutting-edge AI topics to do hands-on research / implementation
- are an experienced coder
- like to understand the full picture top-down
