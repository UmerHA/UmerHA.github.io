title:  Making an eu/acc meetup most useful
---

*This is my thinking about how to make the [eu/acc meetup in Cologne](https://lu.ma/xudwiv6z) most useful. It's intended to be concise & actionable; and **not** marketing speak. For an intro to eu/acc see [https://eu-acc.com/](https://eu-acc.com/).*

I'm organizing a meetup for eu/acc. How can I make it most useful?

## What is eu/acc

eu/acc is a decentralized movement to accelerate innovation in Europe. This is needed, because Europe has world-class talent & research, but is failing to produce world-class companies.

eu/acc believes the root cause for this is not culture or regulation, but fragmentation. Fragmentation creates friction, friction reduces speed, less speed takes away energy.

eu/acc aims to work on ambitious, but specific & implementable projects to address fragmentation. The current projects are:
- European startup legal entity
- blueprint for European holding company (as long as there's no European startup legal entity)

## How can the meetup be valuable to the eu/acc movement?

- verify understanding of problem
    - what's the experience of European founders?
    - what were their pain points?
    - how do they differ from pain points of eg American founders?

- get new project ideas
- get talented & energetic  people into existing projects
- become more widely known


## How can the meetup be valuable to the participants?

Participants can
- meet amazing people
- learn from other European founders
- get involved into projects they believe are impactful
- have fun

Participants are likely very smart & high energy. Don't try to 'tame' them. If the group discussion goes into an unexpected direction, that's totally okay.

## So how should the agenda look like?

Agenda:
- Arrival
    - <i>15min</i>
- Intro of host, establish 'meetup culture'
    - event is respectful, english-friendly, without partisan politics
    - okay to ask questions any time 
    - <i>5min</i>
- Fast Intro round
    - Who are you?
    - What do you do professionally?
    - Why did you join today? What are your expectations?
    - <i>10-20min</i>
- Presentation of eu/acc & (optionally) overview of projects
    - Allow for discussion during presentation
    - <i>10-30min, depending on discussion</i>
- Free mingling so participants can talk about presentation
    - <i>30min</i>
- Collect output in group discussion
    - Did you agree, disagree with eu/acc's thesis & projects
    - What else do you want to share with group
    - Do you want to get involved somehow?
        - In an existing project
        - In a new initiative
    - How can we support you best?
    - <i>30-60min</i>

- Social mingling
    - open-ended

Total time: 2-3h plus open-ended social mingling

After the meetup:
- Post summary to eu/acc discord
- Mail summary to attendees & keep their energy high (to make it more likely plans are followed through)
