title: "A Practitioner's Guide to Triton"
---

For the [cuda mode](https://github.com/cuda-mode/) community, I gave a lecture titled "A Practitioner's Guide to Triton". My goal was to give the best possible intro to Triton, which to me means:
- tell you when you'd use it, and when to use something else
- clearly state what knowledge I assume and introduce everything else
- teach by practically working through examples, only adding a manageable amount of complexity each time
- guide you to places where you can learn more
